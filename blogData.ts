        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'At the heart of Posh Lounge is a passion for culinary innovation. Our menu is a testament to the art of fusion, a delicate dance between the bold, aromatic flavors of Thailand and the diverse techniques of global cuisine. It’s a journey for the palate, where familiar tastes are reimagined and new classics are born. But what exactly is fusion, and how do we bring it to life on your plate?' },
        { type: 'heading', text: 'Our Culinary Philosophy' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Fusion cuisine is about more than just mixing ingredients from different countries. It’s a philosophy that respects tradition while embracing creativity. It involves a deep understanding of the core flavor profiles of each culinary style—the sweet, sour, salty, and spicy of Thai food, the rich and savory notes of Continental classics—and finding harmonious ways to blend them. The result is dishes that are both surprising and delightfully coherent.' },
        { type: 'heading', text: 'Signature Fusions on Your Plate' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Our chefs have masterfully crafted a menu that showcases this philosophy. Take our bestselling **Thai Pizza**, for example. We\'ve taken the beloved Italian staple and infused it with the quintessential flavors of Thailand. Imagine a crispy crust topped not with marinara, but with a tangy, slightly spicy sauce, grilled chicken, fresh herbs, and a hint of peanut. It\'s an unexpected combination that has quickly become a guest favorite.' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Another star is the **Chili Crab Crunch**. This dish reimagines the famous Singaporean chili crab by transforming it into a crispy, bite-sized delight. We capture the essence of the rich, savory sauce and succulent crab meat within a crunchy wonton, making it perfect for sharing and socializing without losing any of the authentic flavor.' },
        { type: 'heading', text: 'Commitment to Freshness and Quality' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'True fusion is only possible with the highest quality ingredients. We are committed to sourcing the freshest local produce, premium meats and seafood, and authentic spices from trusted suppliers. This dedication ensures that every dish we serve is vibrant, flavorful, and a true representation of our culinary vision. From our kitchen to your table, we invite you to explore a world of flavor, right here above the Dhaka skyline.' },
